Afterwards, Aindel forms Minor Tribes' Confederation to protect all minorities who have no allegiance to a particular country, and is crowned the leader of the group. However, the striking differences among the four tribes render the alliance shaky at best, and susceptible to external influences who threat its existence. When Aindel learns from Sigruna of a town where many races live in harmony, he immediately sets out on the road, hiding his royal identity. A king must always protect his people, and all of the Confederation has become his.",

However, despite their long training and mastery, they continuously fail to overcome their last trial of wisdom, remaining as 'Half Saints.' Although the Master Ethereal teaches Lu Dongbin and He Xiangu Weiqi to guide them to their path, the two disciples fail to understand their master's meaning: Lu Dongbin cannot stand losing, while He Xiangu can never bring herself to sacrifice a single stone. The Master Ethereal finally tells the two disciples to go and meet other masters of Weiqi in the hopes that they will finally achieve enlightenment. In the lands of Chen, where the two begin their ruthless winning streak, Lu Dongbin and He Xiangu win round after round of Weiqi. Their pride in their countless victories leads them to hear rumors of an expert of the name of Hansung, whom they challenge at once. Although the match between the two Saints and Hansung continues for three days and three nights, victory falls to no one. When Lu Dongbin and He Xiangu, struck with his skill, ask Hansung how an \"ordinary human\" can play Weiqi so well, the wise warrior tells them to go to Hero Town - where they shall find their answer.",
